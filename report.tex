\section{Weyl Formula}
The number of eigenvalues of wavelength in the interval $[0,k]$ is given by the Weyl formula
\begin{equation}
C^w_{0,k} = \frac{\mbox{Area}}{4 \pi} k^2 - \frac{\mbox{Perimeter}}{4 \pi} k + o(XXX)
\end{equation}
We thus dedcuce that the number of eigenvalues in the interval $[k_a, k_b]$ is given by
\begin{equation}
C^w_{k_a,k_b} = \frac{\mbox{Area}}{4 \pi} (k_b^2 -k_a^2) - \frac{\mbox{Perimeter}}{4 \pi} (k_b - k_a) + o(XXX)
\end{equation}

\section{Examples: Dirichlet eigenvalues}
\paragraph{}
In this section we present a numerical investigation of three methods used to compute Dirichlet eigenvalues.
The computation is performed with the MATLAB toolbox mpspack \cite{MPS}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
  \draw[thick,smooth, domain=0:2*pi,fill=gray,samples=200] plot (
        xy polar cs:angle=\x r, radius={1+0.3*cos(deg(3*\x+0.6*sin(deg(\x))))}
    );
  \node at (0.5,-1) {$\Omega$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{The non-symmetric, smooth domain $\Omega$.}
\end{figure}
We construct a domain $\Omega$ from the region enclosed by the parametric function
\[
\theta \mapsto (\theta, 1 + 0.3 \cos( 3 \theta + 0.6 \sin \theta))
\]
in polar coordinates, for $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$.
We are interested in computing eigenvalues $k^2_j$ of the Dirichlet Laplacian. That is, \\
\begin{align*}
(\Delta + k_j^2) \phi_j = 0 & \quad \mbox{in } \Omega, \\
\phi_j  = 0 & \quad \mbox{on } \partial \Omega.
\end{align*}
where $\phi_j$ are the associated eigenfunctions.
\paragraph{}
We discretise the boundary into $N$ evenly spaced points and search for the $k_j$.
Since $\Omega$ is non-symmetric the multiplicity of each eigenvalue will be one.
The following is a comparison of the performance of the various methods built into mpspack.
Each calculation is repeated 5 times and an average is taken.
\paragraph{}
We plot the time taken to search for the eigenvalues as a function of $k$ and $N$.
The number of eigenvalues found $N_{k,k+1}$ is compared to the number expected $C^w_{k,k+1}$ by the Weyl formula \ref{weyl}.
The colour of the plot is given by $|C_{k,k+1} - C^w_{k,k+1}|$.
\subsection{Neumann-to-Dirichlet method}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{dtn.eps} \\
Observe that the expected $O(N^2)$ growth in the runtime is clear.
We also observe a small but significant growth in the runtime as $k$ increases for fixed $N$.
\subsection{Fredholm determinant method}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fd.eps} \\
The Fredholm determinant method is significantly slower than the Neumann-to-Dirichlet method.
The runtime apears to depend linearly on $k$ and quadratically on $N$.
That is, the runtime looks like $O(Nk^2)$.
The Fredholm determinant method appears to be less resiliant to undersampling when compared to the Neumann-to-Dirichelt method.
\subsection{Method of particular solutions}
\paragraph{}
The method of particular solutions was even slower still.
In fact, the number of points had to be reduced in order to complete the calculations in a reasonable time. \\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ms.eps} \\
The runtime behaviour of the particular solutions method is interesting.
It appears to be linear in $k$, at least when $N$ is large.
There is also a clear dependence on $N$, it appears quadratic, for small $k$.
There is a critical ridge along the line approximately $N = 3 k$.
The runtime drops for $N < 3k$ and the method misses some eigenvalues.
